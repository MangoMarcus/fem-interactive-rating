# Frontend Mentor - Interactive rating component solution

This is a solution to the [Interactive rating component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI).

I only used the design images for reference, I didn't have access to the figma/sketch/xd files.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

### Live demo

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [BEM naming convention](http://getbem.com/introduction/)
- [Vue.js framework](https://vuejs.org/)

### What I learned

* Performant color animations using opacity and pseudo elements
* Centering using `display: grid;` and `place-items: center;`
* Styling radio inputs
* Frontend Mentor worflow and GitHub pages
* Vue form input binding with `v-model`

### Continued development

* Rating buttons might be a good candidate for their own component.
* Mobile-first design - [adding complexity for desktop rather than removing it for mobile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ohtVzCSHqs)
